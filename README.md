Project Name: Student Mark Predictor

Description:

The Student Mark Predictor is a machine learning-based project designed to predict studentsâ€™ future marks based on their past performance and study patterns. It collects inputs such as previous exam scores, attendance percentage, study hours, and assignment completion rates. Using these features, the model predicts the likely marks a student may achieve in upcoming exams, helping students and educators identify areas for improvement early.

The project uses Python with libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib for data processing, model building, and visualization. We experimented with multiple regression algorithms (Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor) and evaluated them using MAE and RMSE to select the best-performing model.

This project helped in understanding feature engineering, data cleaning, model training and testing, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation of regression models. We also built a simple Tkinter GUI (or a Streamlit app, if applicable) to allow users to input their data and see predicted marks instantly.
